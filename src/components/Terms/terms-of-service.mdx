## SKALE Metaport Bridge UI Terms of Use

The SKALE Network (“we,” “us,” “our,” etc.) makes the SKALE Metaport Bridge UI (the “Bridge User Interface”) available to help users transfer cryptographic tokens (“Tokens”) between the Ethereum blockchain and any SKALE blockchain.  The Bridge UI does not itself initiate or process any such transfer or at any time have custody or control of any Tokens.  It merely facilitates such transfers by providing a link between the Ethereum blockchain and the applicable SKALE blockchain. 

All uses of the Bridge are subject to these SKALE Bridge UI Terms of Use (these “Terms”).  Accordingly, if you use the Bridge UI, you and we mutually agree that these Terms will constitute a binding, legally enforceable contract between you and us.

**THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN THE “ARBITRATION” SECTION BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES.  IT DOES NOT ALLOW JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND.**

### NO WARRANTIES

_The Bridge UI is provided AS IS, without any warranties of any type or nature.  **Your use of the Bridge UI is at your sole risk.**  To the full extent permissible under applicable law, we specifically disclaim all implied warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.  The duration of any implied warranty that is not effectively disclaimed will be limited to the longer of (i) thirty (30) days from the date that you first accept these Terms and (ii) the shortest period allowed under applicable law._

Some jurisdictions do not permit the disclaimer of implied warranties or limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts; therefore, some or all of the provisions of this section may not apply to you.

Without limiting the foregoing, you acknowledge that there are inherent risks associated with transfers of digital assets recorded on any blockchain, such as Tokens. These risks include, but are not limited to, the failure of hardware, software or internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction and the risk of unauthorized access to your digital wallet via cyberattacks or otherwise. Further, transfers of digital assets such as Tokens are, as a rule, irreversible. Consequently, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transfers are generally not recoverable. Thus, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or fraud, Tokens may be irretrievably lost, corrupted, damaged or stolen or become inaccessible. We will not have any liability of any type or nature arising out of or relating to the loss, corruption or theft of or damage to Tokens.  

### LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

_In no event shall we, our affiliates or our licensors, or our or their respective employees, agents, directors, officers or shareholders, be liable with respect to the Bridge UI, any use thereof, or otherwise relating in any way to the subject matter of these Terms (however arising, including negligence) for (i) any lost or corrupted Tokens or other data, lost profits or any special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages or (ii) the cost of procuring substitute goods, services, products or technology._

_To the full extent permissible under applicable law, our aggregate liability to you arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Bridge UI or any Tokens is limited to $10._

Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions shall only apply to the extent permissible under applicable law.

### INDEMNIFICATION

_You will be responsible for and will pay us, our affiliates, and our and our affiliates&#39; respective employees, representatives, agents, vendors and licensors (collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”) the amount of any loss, damage, fine, penalty, liability, cost or expense (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys&#39; fees) (collectively, “Losses”) incurred by us or any of the Indemnified Persons arising in any way out of or in connection with your use of the Bridge UI or otherwise relating to any Tokens, excluding any Losses to the extent attributable to our violation of law, or, in the case of Losses incurred by any Indemnified Person, that Indemnified Person&#39;s violation of law._

### AMENDMENTS TO THESE TERMS

We may change these Terms at any time by posting a new version of these Terms.  Any use of the Bridge UI after any such change will be subject to the version of the Terms in effect at the time of such use.

### INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION

We want to address any concerns that you may have without the need for a formal dispute resolution process. Before commencing arbitration against us, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute (as defined below) informally by contacting us via e-mail at legal@skalelabs.com, to notify us of the actual or potential Dispute.  Similarly, we will undertake reasonable efforts to contact you to notify you of any actual or potential dispute to resolve any claim we may possess informally before taking any formal action. The party that provides the notice of the actual or potential Dispute (the “Notifying Party”) will include in that notice (a “Notice of Dispute”) your name (to the extent known), the Notifying Party&#39;s contact information for any communications relating to such Dispute (including for the Notifying Party&#39;s legal counsel if it is represented by counsel in connection with such Dispute), and sufficient details regarding such Dispute to enable the other party (the “Notified Party”) to understand the basis of and evaluate the concerns raised.  If the Notified Party responds within ten (10) business days after receiving the Notice of Dispute that it is ready and willing to engage in good faith discussions in an effort to resolve the Dispute informally, then each party shall promptly participate in such discussions in good faith.

### ARBITRATION

This agreement to arbitrate applies to you only if your Country of Residence is the United States.  “Country of Residence” for purposes of this agreement to arbitrate means the country in which you hold citizenship or legal permanent residence; provided that if you have more than one country of citizenship or legal permanent residence, it shall be the country in which you hold citizenship or legal permanent residence with which you most closely are associated by permanent or most frequent residence.

You and we agree that any and all past, present and future disputes, controversies, claims, or causes of action arising out of or relating to Bridge UI or any Tokens, or arising out of or relating to these Terms, and any other controversies or disputes between you and us (including disputes regarding the effectiveness, scope, validity or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate) (collectively, “Dispute(s)”), shall be determined by arbitration, unless (A) you opt out as provided below or (B) your Dispute is subject to an exception to this agreement to arbitrate set forth below.  You and we further agree that any arbitration pursuant to this section shall not proceed as a class, group or representative action.  The award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

If notwithstanding the Notifying Party&#39;s compliance with all of its obligations above relating to the informal resolution of Disputes, a Dispute is not resolved within 30 days after the Notice of Dispute is sent (or if the Notified Party fails to respond to the Notice of Dispute within ten (10) business days), the Notifying Party may initiate an arbitration proceeding as described below.  If either party purports to initiate arbitration without first providing a Notice of Dispute and otherwise complying with all of its obligations under the preceding paragraph, then, notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, the arbitrator(s) will promptly dismiss the claim with prejudice and will award the other party all of its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees) incurred in connection with such Dispute.

Unless you opt out of this agreement to arbitrate as provided below, you and we each agree to resolve any Disputes that are not resolved informally as described above through final and binding arbitration as discussed herein, subject to the exceptions set forth below.

If you do not wish to be subject to this agreement to arbitrate, you may opt out of this arbitration provision by sending a notice via e-mail at legal@skalelabs.com, within thirty (30) days of the first time you accept these Terms (or any prior version of these Terms) or, if earlier, your first use the Bridge UI. You must date the notice and include your first and last name, address, and a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration. If no notice is submitted in the manner described above by the 30-day deadline, you will have irrevocably waived your right to litigate any Dispute except to the extent of the exceptions set forth below. By opting out of the agreement to arbitrate, you will not be precluded from using the App or any Services, but you and we will not be permitted to invoke the mutual agreement to arbitrate to resolve Disputes under the terms otherwise provided herein.

You and we agree that the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes in effect at the time arbitration is sought (“AAA Rules”). Those rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration.) Arbitration will proceed on an individual basis and will be handled by a sole arbitrator. The single arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA&#39;s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within fourteen (14) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitrator(s) shall be authorized to award any remedies, including injunctive relief, that would be available in an individual lawsuit, other than remedies that you effectively waived pursuant to these Terms.  Except as may be and to the extent otherwise required by law, the arbitration proceeding and any award shall be confidential.

You and we further agree that the arbitration will be held in the English language in Santa Clara county, California, or, if you so elect, all proceedings can be conducted via videoconference, telephonically or via other remote electronic means. If we elect arbitration, we shall pay all of the AAA filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees). If you elect arbitration, filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees) shall be paid in accordance with the AAA Rules, or in accordance with countervailing law if contrary to the AAA Rules. However, if the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator(s) finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). In such circumstances, fees will be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules. Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys' fees, except as otherwise provided herein or required by law.  This agreement to arbitrate shall be construed under and be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act (U.S. Code Article 9), notwithstanding any other choice of law set out in these Terms. 

You and we agree that the arbitration of any Dispute shall proceed on an individual basis, and neither you nor we may bring a claim as a part of a class, group, collective, coordinated, consolidated or mass arbitration (each, a “Collective Arbitration”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a claim to resolve any Dispute against us will be deemed a Collective Arbitration if (i) two (2) or more similar claims for arbitration are filed concurrently; and (ii) counsel for the claimants are the same, share fees or coordinate across the arbitrations. “Concurrently” for purposes of this provision means that both arbitrations are pending (filed but not yet resolved) at the same time.

**To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither you nor we shall be entitled to consolidate, join or coordinate disputes by or against other individuals or entities with any Disputes, or to arbitrate or litigate any Dispute in a representative capacity, including as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity. In connection with any Dispute, any and all such rights are hereby expressly and unconditionally waived.** Without limiting the foregoing, any challenge to the validity of this paragraph or otherwise relating to the prohibition of Collective Arbitration shall be determined exclusively by the arbitrator.  

Notwithstanding the agreement between you and us to arbitrate Disputes, you and we each may assert claims, if they qualify, through the small claims process in any courts having jurisdiction.

This agreement to arbitrate shall survive the termination or expiration of these Terms. With the exception of the provisions of this agreement to arbitrate that prohibit Collective Arbitration, if a court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining portions of this agreement to arbitrate shall nevertheless remain valid and in force. If a court finds the prohibition of Collective Arbitration to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement to arbitrate shall be deemed void (but no provisions of these Terms not specifically related to arbitration shall be void), and any remaining Dispute must be litigated in court pursuant to the paragraph below entitled Governing Law.

### GOVERNING LAW

These Terms will  be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of California applicable to contracts entered into and performed in California by California residents; provided that, as stated above, the provisions of these Terms related to arbitration shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (U.S. Code Title 9).  

### IMPORTANT NOTE TO NEW JERSEY CONSUMERS

If you are a consumer residing in New Jersey, the following provisions of these Terms do not apply to you (and do not limit any rights that you may have) to the extent that they are unenforceable under New Jersey law: (a) the disclaimer of liability for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages of any kind (for example, to the extent unenforceable under the New Jersey Punitive Damages Act, New Jersey Products Liability Act, New Jersey Uniform Commercial Code and New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act); (b) the limitations of liability for lost profits or loss or misuse of any data (for example, to the extent unenforceable under the New Jersey Identity Theft Protection Act and New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act); (c) application of the limitations of liability to the recovery of damages that arise under contract and tort, including negligence, strict liability or any other theory (for example, to the extent such damages are recoverable by a consumer under New Jersey law, including the New Jersey Products Liability Act); (d) the requirement that you indemnify us and the other indemnified parties (for example, to the extent the scope of such indemnity is prohibited under New Jersey law); and (e) the governing law provision (for example, to the extent that your rights as a consumer residing in New Jersey are required to be governed by New Jersey law).

### MISCELLANEOUS

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter of these Terms.  Accordingly, these Terms supersede any prior terms relating to that subject matter.

Except as provided above with respect to the provisions of these Terms prohibiting Collective Arbitration, if any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, ineffective or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain valid, effective and enforceable.

If you breach these Terms and we choose not to immediately respond, or choose not to respond at all, we will still be entitled to all rights and remedies at any later date, or in any other situation, where you breach these Terms. No failure to act or delay in acting by us will be deemed to be a waiver of any type.

You may not assign any of your rights or delegate any of your duties or obligations under these Terms, and any purported assignment will be null and void and of no force or effect.
