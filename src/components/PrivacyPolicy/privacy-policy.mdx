### Local Storage Usage Policy

By using or accessing SKALE Bridge, you agree to our Local Storage Usage Policy, which is an integral part of our Privacy Policy. This policy explains our use of the localStorage API to store your transaction history, enhancing your user experience and ensuring the proper functioning of SKALE Bridge.

#### LocalStorage Usage

1. SKALE Bridge exclusively uses the localStorage API to store and retrieve data on your device. This data is limited to your transaction history and is necessary for providing you with an overview of your past transactions within the website.

2. We do not share any data stored in localStorage with third parties. Your transaction history is for your personal reference and will not be shared with others. Furthermore, this data never leaves the device on which it was saved.

3. You can manage your localStorage preferences through your browser settings. Disabling localStorage may affect the functionality and features of SKALE Bridge. By continuing to use SKALE Bridge without changing your localStorage settings, you consent to our use of localStorage as described in this policy.

4. We will periodically review and update this Local Storage Usage Policy to ensure that it remains current and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Your continued use of SKALE Bridge constitutes your agreement to any changes or updates to this policy.

If you have any questions or concerns about our Local Storage Usage Policy, please contact SKALE team.
